This is a US Phone Number Validator Webpage, inspired by my third certification project from freeCodeCamp. The web design is inspired by my previous project, utilizing glassmorphism but with a radial gradient instead of a linear gradient.

## Overview

This webpage allows users to validate US phone numbers. It checks if the input follows the standard US phone number format and provides immediate feedback.

## Features

- **User Input**: Enter any US phone number to validate.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate results on whether the input is a valid US phone number.
- **Interactive Design**: Simple and responsive user interface with glassmorphism and radial gradient design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including glassmorphism and radial gradient effects.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the phone number validation logic.

## Acknowledgements

- [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): The core logic is based on the Telephone Number Validator Project from [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/).
